# Build AYON launcher on Linux

**WARNING:** Linux needs distribution specific steps.

We highly recommend to use prepared docker build options for Linux. If you want to build AYON on your local machine, the following steps may not be fully working for every case.

## Requirements
---

To build AYON you will need some tools and libraries. We do not provide any of these tools. You have to install them yourself.
- [**bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [**curl**](https://curl.se) on systems that doesn't have one preinstalled
- [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [**Python 3.9**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
- [**CMake**](https://cmake.org/)

Python 3.9.0 is not supported because of [this bug](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/22670).

It is recommended to use [**pyenv**](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for python version control.

To build Python related stuff, you need Python header files installed (`python3-dev` on Ubuntu for example).

### Prepare requirements
<details>
<summary>Details for Ubuntu</summary>
Install git, cmake and curl

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential checkinstall
sudo apt install git cmake curl
```
#### Note:
In case you run in error about `xcb` when running AYON,
you'll need also additional libraries for Qt5:

```sh
sudo apt install qt6-default
```
or if you are on Ubuntu > 20.04, there is no `qt6-default` packages so you need to install its content individually:

```sh
sudo apt-get install qtbase6-dev qtchooser qt6-qmake qtbase6-dev-tools
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Details for Centos 7</summary>
Note that centos 7 is old OS and some of the packages are not available so there might be used older versions. For example still uses PySide2 instead of PySide6.
Install git, cmake and curl

```sh
sudo yum install qit cmake
```

#### Note:
In case you run in error about `xcb` when running AYON,
you'll need also additional libraries for Qt5:

```sh
sudo yum install qt5-qtbase-devel
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Use pyenv to install Python version for AYON build</summary>

You will need **bzip2**, **readline**, **sqlite3** and other libraries.

For more details about Python build environments see:

https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment

**For Ubuntu:**
```sh
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

**For Centos:**
```sh
yum install gcc zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel readline-devel sqlite sqlite-devel openssl-devel tk-devel libffi-devel
```

**install pyenv**
```sh
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# you can add those to ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

# reload shell
exec $SHELL

# install Python 3.9.x
pyenv install -v 3.9.13

# change path to repository
cd /path/to/ayon-launcher

# set local python version
pyenv local 3.9.13

```
</details>

## Build

#### Clone repository
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ynput/ayon-launcher.git
```

#### Prepare environment
Create virtual environment in `./.venv` and install python runtime dependencies like PySide, Pillow..

**For Centos:**
Centos does not support default version of PySide6. We've prepared last supported version, all you need to do is to set environment variable `QT_BINDING` to `centos7`.

```
./tools/make.sh create-env
./tools/make.sh install-runtime-dependencies
```

#### Build AYON Desktop
Build AYON in `./build/`.
```
./tools/make.sh build
```

Build should create `./build/AYON {version}.app` file.

#### Create installer
Create installer that can be distributed to server and workstations.
```
./tools/make.sh make-installer
```

Output installer is in `./build/installer/` directory. You should find `.dmg` and `.json` file. JSON file contains metadata required for server.
